# Ender-3-Max-Custom-Firmware
Custom Marlin Firmware for the ender 3 max, please join discord: https://discord.gg/mTDDt68uXw if you have questions or need help.

This code is designed for an Ender 3 Max with a 300C hotend and CR/BL touch. The code was made to work with my modified Ender 3 Max which has lots of upgrades. 
The printer I use has a sprite extruder pro, cr touch, silent fans with buck converters, dual z, a custom tool holder, and modified psu placement.
I plan to make more upgrades including silent part cooling as right now only the psu and motherboard have it, as well as watercooling for the hotend to get rid of loud fan noise.
I want the Ender 3 Max to become a more user friendly printer as creality has slowly attempted to faze out the printer in my opinion.
With the help of the code and discord, I hope you are able to upgrade your ender.
Happy printing!
